COMP272 Programming Assignment 4 

This assignment has two parts:

(1) The first being that you must complete the implementation of select methods within the Hash Map (Hash Table) object provided in file myHashMap.java. This object emulates the HashMap object within Java’s Collection Framework Library. This class implements many of the Java library’s class’s methods and emulates the behavior of the Map interface, which is what the Java Library class does.

(2) Second is solving simple collection problems contained within the file HashProblems.java. For each problem, you are to use the HashMap object contained within the Java Collection Framework library. Note that HashMap’s internal implementation is using ArrayList (for buckets) and LinkedList (for the collision chain), which is the same approach being used by our implementation referred to above.

This main file is a driver for testing these methods that you write within the files ‘myHashMap.java’ and ‘HashProblems.java’. Your work will need to pass all the tests for 100.

Refer to the provided PDF for the specific requirements of each part.
